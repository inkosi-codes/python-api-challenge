## Observations and Analysis

Latitudes from 40 to 80 above the equator seems to have temperatures that starts decrease even dipping below zero degress fahrenheit. The curve in temperature change seems to occur on the axis of (20,80).

There is a more define slope in the Northern Hemisphere with an r-value of .78, that demonstrates that as the latitude climbs the temperature continues on a steady decline, whereas in the Southern Hemisphere the temperature change is slower on a incline and move spread out and the trend continues.

North of the equator ranging 20-40 degrees, appears to be the most humid part of the world.
